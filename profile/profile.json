We created queries to Insert, Update and Delete records from tables, used Joins to combine tables for more complex views into our data, and Subqueries to collect and display specific information, like the facility with the highest bookings.",

The use of Lambda expressions for filtering data makes the underlying code more expressive, and therefore easier to understand. The app uses SLF4J to log any errors to the User, and allows the User to provide an out file where all matches will be written. The Grep app was also Dockerized for easier distribution.",
