**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DavidGordon/tree/master/linux_sql)]: The Linux Cluster Monitoring Agent is a simple yet powerful solution to gathering a host system's hardware information and usage. This product is intended for IT teams who need a way to log and review their systems usage to manage server costs and performance.

**Sql Queries** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_DavidGordon/tree/master/sql)]: The SQL Queries project consists of several SQL tables that contain different relations to one another, in a PostgreSQL database running in a docker container. The purpose of this project was to become more familiar with SQL and it's various features, such as Aggregate functions, String functions, Joins, Unions and more. We created queries to Insert, Update and Delete records from tables, used Joins to combine tables for more complex views into our data, and Subqueries to collect and display specific information, like the facility with the highest bookings.


## Highlighted Projects
**Flashtyper type tester** [[GitHub](https://github.com/davidgordon12/FlashTyper-MVC)]: Online typing speed tracker with a global leaderboard. Written in C# ASP.NET, data is stored in a Microsoft SQL Server database, hosted in the cloud via Azure

**Epistle** [[GitHub](https://github.com/davidgordon12/epistle)]: Note-taking web application focused on simplicity and portability. Allows the user to create 'Bookshelves' to store and organize their notes. Implemented in ASP.NET Core, EntityFrameworkCore and Microsft SQL Server database.
